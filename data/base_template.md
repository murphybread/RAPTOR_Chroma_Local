 description: We now have a technology called Docker that allows us to build environments quickly and easily. It's an evolution of virtualization going back a long way, and while the speed is an advantage, my personal favorite is that it provides a consistent environment. It is possible to guarantee and share dev, stage, production environments, excluding external environments, and later manage them in the form of IaC. I think this is the reason why Docker is so popular, widely used, and evolving.

## 100/110/110.20/110.20.md
 description: AWS is a public cloud. The main reason for using the largest cloud is to have elastic resources. I can easily rent a 10,000 dollars server or a 100,000 dollars server by the hour. It's good for small businesses because it can support company-level scale and performance. However, as the scale grows and the network becomes more complex, using the cloud can become a poison. As always, it's important to use it in moderation.

 description: ProlificDreamer, presented at NeurIPS 2023, introduces a method for text-to-3D generation using Variational Score Distillation (VSD), which addresses issues found in existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) methods like over-saturation and low diversity. The paper proposes treating 3D parameters as random variables to enhance diversity and quality. The approach incorporates various improvements, including better distillation scheduling and density initialization, leading to high-fidelity, photo-realistic NeRFs and meshes with detailed structure and complex effects.
